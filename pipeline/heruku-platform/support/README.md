# How to get support from Heroku ?

When you fall upon an issue such as [this one](ccc), which is about the platform itself (not meta tools like the `Heroku CLI`, but the platform itself), well there is no way you will get any support, no way you can report an issue, but by paying :

I think this is a mistake, in the Heroku business model.
