# --- HEROKU ENV.

# https://help.heroku.com/PPBPA231/how-do-i-use-the-port-environment-variable-in-container-based-apps
#
# In a word :
# Heroku platform will assign a value to the PORT variable, and
# do the network setup with reverse proxying. So Basically I just haveto know that
# the PORT environment variable is there where the network will happen, where the network traffic will travel : I can listen on that port if I want, for example
# At any rate, I should NOT EVER
# EXPOSE $PORT

# Okay, so my Apache HTTP Server should listen on port number defined by $PORT
ARG PORT
